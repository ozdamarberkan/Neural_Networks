To run code:

- Open Command Prompt as administrator.
- Go to the current directory
- Type: 

python Question1.py
python Question2.py
python Question3.py
python Question4.py

to execute the code for corresponding question.

Important Note: In the Question1.py, the code runs in the Jupyter Notebook for me but run in a command prompt in one of my computers. I could not resolve the issue. 
The other questions runs both in the Jupyter environment and command prompt.

Important Note: For Question1, latest version of the numpy receives SVD did not converge error. The corresponding cell needs to be runned again but 
from command prompt it cannot be done. So, either the code must be executed with an older version of numpy or the Jupyter Notebook should be used and the 
corresponding cell needs to be executed twice if the error is received.
